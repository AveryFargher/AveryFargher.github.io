          I've been a casual user of photoshop since 2020, using it to edit images and make digital art. In 2024, I began to 
          take interest in graphic design and started experimenting with photoshop's features to make abstract/glitchy pieces. 
          I'm currently aiming on doing freelance design and working with other creatives.
